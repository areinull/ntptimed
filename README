PLOTTING FAST HELP

1 Testing syncronizer:
- run test_sync_ts with required connection and other options for several minutes,
  this will allow you to collect sufficient amount of timestamps for analys, terminate with Ctrl+C
  (Ex.: ./test_sync_ts -d/dev/ttyM0 -s115200 -l/tmp/dump.bin)
- run plot_sync_ts.py Python to plot graph and show some statictics on the
  collected data
  (Ex.: ./plot_sync_ts.py /tmp/dump.bin x)

2 Testing ntptimed:
- run ntptime_client with required connection and other options for several minutes,
  this will allow you to collect sufficient amount of timestamps for analys, terminate with Ctrl+C;
  binary file will be ./log.bin
  (Ex.: ./ntptime_client -t --refresh 100000)
- run plot_ntptimed_ts.py Python to plot graph and show some statictics on the
  collected data
  (Ex.: ./plot_ntptimed_ts.py ../build/log.bin x)

Note: you'll might want to change paths in examples.
